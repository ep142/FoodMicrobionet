This is an old version of the FMBN analyzer script.
This script was created as a way to run graphical and statistical analysis on data extracted from FoodMicrobionet v 3.1 using the ShinyFMBN v1.2 app.
You can learn more on these versions of the database and the app here: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0168160519301692?via%3Dihub
The material is also available on Mendeley data where you can find the most recent version

Basically, the FMBN analyzer will let you import a list created with the ShinyFMBN app (you have to save using the <agg> button).
Instructions are provided as comments in the code, but basically:
1. you can set a few options about saving graphs, performing rarefaction, filtering etc.
2. do bar graphs for abundance
3. perform MDS on the OTU table and get both the sample and taxa plots
4. create heatmaps
5. do some bipartite network analysis
