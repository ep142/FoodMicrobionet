#### FoodMicrobionet  

FoodMicrobionet is a database of studies on the composition of the bacterial microbiota of food obtained by
amplicon targeted (16S RNA gene or 16S RNA for bacteria, ITS1, ITS2 18S RNA gene or 26S RNA gene for fungi) high throughput sequencing.
Data are organized in tables:

* __Studies__: information of studies, including external links to the publications  

* __Samples__: metadata on samples for each study, including hierarchical classification using EFSA [FoodEx2](https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2903/sp.efsa.2025.EN-9414) food classification scheme  

* __Taxa__: metadata on fungal and bacterial taxa, including links to external resources  

* __Edges__: data on abundance of taxa in samples

#### ShinyFMBN  

This is the stand-alone version of ShinyFMBN v4, an interactive app designed to simplify the access to FoodMicrobionet.  

1. **Select a subset of data** (bacteria or fungi) from the dropdown menu  

2. Use the **Explore** panel to explore studies and samples within subsets of studies  

3. Use the **Filter** panel to subset and aggregate samples from one or more study, with optional taxa aggregation  

4. Use the **Export** panel and its tabs to export data and to summarize them with simple tables and plots (plot save options can be selected in the **Save options** panel)
