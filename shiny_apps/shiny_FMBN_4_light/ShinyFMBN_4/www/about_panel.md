#### About FoodMicrobionet.

FoodMicrobionet is a database of studies on the composition of the bacterial microbiota of food obtained by amplicon targeted (16S RNA gene or 16S RNA for bacteria, ITS1, ITS2 18S RNA gene or 26S RNA gene for fungi) high throughput sequencing.  

Data are organized in tables:  

* __Studies__: metadata on studies  

* __Samples__: metadata on samples for each study, including hierarchical classification using EFSA [FoodEx2](https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2903/sp.efsa.2025.EN-9414) food classification scheme, and much more

* __Edges__: taxa abundance for each sample  

* __Taxa__: metadata on taxa"))

Other service tables provide further functionalities. To learn more on FoodMicrobionet and its development visit my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ep142/FoodMicrobionet)

#### About this app.  

ShinyFMBN (v4 light) is designed to provide a graphical user interface to:  

1. explore studies and samples;

2. extract/filter groups of samples;

3. (optionally) perform aggregation of samples or taxa

4. (locally) save data for further analysis;

5. generate and save some summary tables and graphs.  

A stand alone version is available on [Mendeley data](https://dx.doi.org/10.17632/8fwwjpm79y).
