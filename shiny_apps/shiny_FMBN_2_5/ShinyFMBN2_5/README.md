### About FoodMicrobionet

FoodMicrobionet is a database of studies on the composition of the bacterial microbiota of food obtained by amplicon targeted (16S RNA gene or 16S RNA) high throughput sequencing.

Data are organized in tables:

* Studies: metadata on studies
* Samples: metadata on samples for each study
* Edges: taxa abundance for each sample
* Taxa: metadata on taxa
* To learn more on FoodMicrobionet and its development visit [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/ep142/FoodMicrobionet). 

### About this app

This app (version 2.5) is designed to provide an interface to:

* explore studies and samples;  

* extract/filter groups of samples;  

* (optionally) perform aggregation of samples or taxa;  

* (locally) save data for further analysis  

* carry out minimal exploration of the dataset extracted from FMBN by using graphs and tables
