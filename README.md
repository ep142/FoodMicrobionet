# FoodMicrobionet

This repository will eventually contain the [FoodMicrobionet database](http://www.foodmicrobionet.org) (as a R list and as Shiny apps) and a selection of the R scripts created to:  

* process raw sequences;  
* assemble the database;
* perform repeatable statistical and graphical analysis of the data extracted from FoodMicrobionet using the ShinyFMBN . The top level will also contain the scripts used to launch the different versions of the app.
